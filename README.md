## What??
This is a repository holding some files concerning measuring emerald ashborer larvae activity through an ESP32W. We were assigned this as a capstone project from Loyola Chicago, working with the Morton Arboretum. It uses the PCNT module to obtain
frequency values from analog microphones and uploads them to a Google Sheet. The sheet must be made per tree, copying the sheet_code into a script
and putting the script ID into the .ino file.

## How to use?
Please see the manual uploaded for a list of materials and guides on (generally) how to set up the system. It will most likely require some computer
knowledge and some troubleshooting skills.
